title: Should we be discussing Coronavirus in the classroom?
---

Here are some things to consider. 

1. **Secure your oxygen mask before helping others.** The first thing to consider when questioning whether Coronavirus should be discussed in the classroom is how it may impact _you_ as an instructor. 

2. **This is an historic moment**. If you feel personally mentally prepared, it may be worth discussing. This is a defining moment in history. The [Smithsonian’s Natural Museum of American History has called on Americans to record this moment](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/us/coronavirus-pandemic-historians-archive.html) via diary entries, social media posts, etc; your teaching is part of this moment too.

3. **Engage in trama-informed pedagogy**. As the reach of this virus continues to grow, the likelihood of having students directly impacted is increasing. This is important to keep in mind. In [a recent editorial in AJPH](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.2020.305710), Nadia Abuelezam writes, "Trauma-informed pedagogy ensures that students feel emotionally and physically safe in our classrooms and reduces the risks of retraumatization."

4. **Consider the type of data you examine**. In the early days of this pandemic, many were focusing on _forecasting_. This is a particularly difficult problem, even for experts! Consider addressing other questions in the classroom. For example, this year's [ASA DataFest](https://datafest-edi.github.io/web/) was based on COVID-19 data, but recommended exploring the societal impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic other than its direct health outcomes, for example the impact on pollution levels, transportation levels, or working from home.

5. **Consider including students in the decision**. Several professors have been using polling to gauge student interest in these topics. You can consider letting students drive how much/little content related to this subject is included throughout the semester.

6. **Consider checking in with students periodically**. If you plan on discussing this, consider semi-frequent opportunities for students to provide feedback. It is possible that students polled at the beginning of the semester on whether they would like to discuss this topic may have a strong change of heart as the semester goes on.

7. **Add a line to your syllabus**. Consider adding a line to your syllabus to give students a heads up that this will be discussed.
