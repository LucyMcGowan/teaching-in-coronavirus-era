Do you have data to add? You can either:

1. Add it yourself and submit a pull request
2. [Submit an issue](https://github.com/LucyMcGowan/teaching-in-coronavirus-era/issues/new) and I will add it

If you opt for #1, fork this repo and create a `.md` file under [`content/data`](https://github.com/LucyMcGowan/teaching-in-coronavirus-era/tree/master/content/data) containing information about the data set. Then submit a pull request & I'll merge it in.
